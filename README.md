Geosoftware 2 Project @ IfGI (Institute for Geoinformatics, Münster (WWU) ) 

We have to create a Website to analyse collaboratively datasets of satelites imagery.
This includes a live chat with participants, searching for datasets and analysing the data with r.
The datasets should also be modifiable in form of photoshopping.
